# go-grpc-microservices
Microservices project that uses gRPC for inter-service communication.

Service API definitons use Protocol Buffers. They are managed along with the generated source code in a separate repository: https://github.com/hollowdll/grpc-microservices-proto

Each microservice uses its own hexagonal architecture.

This project is being developed as part of a thesis that discusses the use cases and benefits of using gRPC for microservice inter-service communication.
